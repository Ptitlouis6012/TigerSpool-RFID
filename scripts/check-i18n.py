"""The translation tables are positional. Nothing in the compiler checks that.

firmware/src/i18n.cpp holds one row per string, all languages side by side, in
the column order of `enum Lang` in i18n.h. There is a static_assert, and it
checks the number of *rows* against the enum - nothing else.

So these all compile cleanly today:

  - A language block one column out of place. Every string in that language is
    silently wrong, in a language the person who edits it usually cannot read.
  - A row with one entry too few. The remainder is zero-filled by aggregate
    initialisation and a NULL pointer reaches lv_label_set_text.
  - An empty string, which draws as nothing at all and reads as a layout bug.
  - A /* S_KEY */ comment that no longer matches the row it labels, which sends
    the next reader to the wrong line.

Counting is not enough: order is the failure mode. This checks the comments
against the enum position by position.

There are two tables. The second is the four-language set in webcfg.cpp used by
the legacy configuration page - a different axis from the device's eight, and
checked on its own terms rather than against them.
